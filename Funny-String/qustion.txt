You are given a string, and your task is to determine whether it's Funny or Not Funny based on a specific rule.

🔍 The Rule:
Reverse the string.

For both the original and reversed strings:

Calculate the absolute difference between ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Example: For string acxz
ASCII of a = 97, c = 99, x = 120, z = 122
So:

|a - c| = 2

|c - x| = 21

|x - z| = 2
→ Result: [2, 21, 2]

If the differences are the same in both the original and reversed string → It is Funny.
Otherwise → It is Not Funny.

🧠 Your goal:
Check if both the original string and its reverse have the same sequence of ASCII differences.

Let me know if you’d like help writing the function or want a dry run of a sample test case.
