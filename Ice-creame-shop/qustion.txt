🧊 Story/Scenario:
Two friends go to an ice cream parlor.

They always:

Pool their money together (given as m)

Choose two different ice cream flavors

Spend all their money exactly (not more, not less)

🧠 Your Job:
Given:

A list of ice cream prices (like [1, 4, 5, 3, 2])

The total money they have (say m = 4)

You must:

Find two different ice creams whose prices add up to m

Return their indices (1-based indexing) in ascending order

📝 Important Notes:
1-based indexing: So if the flavor is at position 0 in the array, you return 1

There's always exactly one solution in the input (you don’t have to worry about multiple or no solutions)

You may have to solve this for multiple trips (cases)

✅ Example:
Let's take one:

java
Copy
Edit
Money they have (m): 4
Ice cream prices: [1, 4, 5, 3, 2]
Now, go through the list:

1 + 3 = 4 → Found!

Index of 1 = 0 → becomes 1

Index of 3 = 3 → becomes 4

So, output: 1 4
