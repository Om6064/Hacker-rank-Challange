You are given an array of integers. Your goal is to make all elements in the array equal.
To do that, you can delete any number of elements.

👇 What you need to do:
Find the minimum number of deletions needed so that all remaining elements are the same.

🔍 Example:
Input:

ini
Copy
Edit
arr = [3, 3, 2, 1, 3]
You can keep all the 3s.

That means you’ll delete the 2 and the 1.

➡️ After deletion: [3, 3, 3] → all elements equal
✅ Answer: 2 deletions

🧠 Your goal:
Keep the most frequent number and delete the rest.
Because fewer deletions are needed if you keep the most common value.
