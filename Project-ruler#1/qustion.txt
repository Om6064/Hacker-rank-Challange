📜 What’s given
You have t test cases.

For each test case, you’re given a number n.

🎯 Your task
For each n:

Find all numbers less than n that are multiples of 3 or 5.

Add them all together.

Print the sum.

📌 Example
Input:

Copy
Edit
2
10
100
Case 1: n = 10
Numbers less than 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5 → 3, 5, 6, 9
Sum = 23

Case 2: n = 100
Numbers less than 100 that are multiples of 3 or 5 → sum = 2318

Output:

yaml
Copy
Edit
23
2318
🔍 Key point
You never include n itself (only numbers below n).

Multiples of both 3 and 5 (like 15, 30, etc.) are still only added once.

If you want, I can show you how to solve this without looping through all numbers, using a math formula. That’s the trick Project Euler expects.
