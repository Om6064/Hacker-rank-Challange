🍫 Story/Scenario:
Two kids, Lily and Ron, have a chocolate bar made of squares, each square has a number on it.

Lily wants to give Ron a segment (a continuous part) of the chocolate bar such that:

🍰 The number of squares she gives = Ron’s birth month (m)

🎂 The sum of those numbers on the squares = Ron’s birth day (d)

🧠 Your Job:
You are given:

A list of integers (the chocolate squares)

Ron’s birth day (d) and birth month (m)

You must:

Count how many segments (continuous pieces) in the chocolate match the above two rules

📝 Example:
Chocolate bar: [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]
Ron’s birthday: d = 3 (day), m = 2 (month)

Now look for segments of 2 squares that sum to 3:

[1, 2] → sum = 3 ✅

[2, 1] → sum = 3 ✅

[1, 3] → sum = 4 ❌

[3, 2] → sum = 5 ❌

✅ So 2 valid ways → Output: 2

✅ Key Points:
Only look at continuous segments (no skipping)

Count how many match the length = m and sum = d

Let me know if you want logic or code for this too!
