🔍 Explanation of the Question:
You are given:

A budget b

A list of keyboard prices

A list of USB drive prices

Your task is to find the maximum amount of money that can be spent on one keyboard and one USB drive, without going over the budget.

Buy one keyboard and one USB drive

Total cost must be ≤ budget

Copy
Edit
Budget: 10  
Keyboards: [3, 1]  
USB Drives: [5, 2, 8]
Possible combinations (keyboard + USB):

3 + 5 = 8 ✅

3 + 2 = 5 ✅

3 + 8 = 11 ❌ (too expensive)

1 + 5 = 6 ✅

1 + 2 = 3 ✅

1 + 8 = 9 ✅ ✅✅ ← best option within budget

So, the function should return 9.

If no valid combo is found, return -1.
