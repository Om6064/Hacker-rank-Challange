🛣️ Problem Summary – Service Lane
You’re given:

A highway with a parallel service lane.

The service lane has different widths at different points (represented as an array).

A vehicle wants to travel from index start to index end (inclusive).

The maximum size of vehicle that can pass through that segment is **equal to the smallest width in that segment.

📥 Input:
You are given:

n: total number of width points

t: number of test cases

width[]: array of lane widths at each index

t pairs of start and end indices (called cases)

🎯 Goal:
For each test case, determine:

What is the minimum width from start to end?

That’s the maximum size of vehicle that can safely pass that segment.

📊 Example:
Input:
lua
Copy
Edit
width = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]
cases = [[0, 3], [4, 6], [6, 7], [3, 5], [0, 7]]
Output:
Copy
Edit
1
2
3
2
1
💡 Explanation:
Let’s take the first test case:

ini
Copy
Edit
Start = 0, End = 3 → widths = [2, 3, 1, 2]
Minimum = 1 → So vehicle width must be ≤ 1
Repeat this logic for all test cases.

✅ Key Idea:
For each segment, find the minimum width → that’s the maximum vehicle size that can pass.

Great question, Aryan!

🧪 What is a test case in this context?
In this problem, a test case represents one driving scenario, where:

The driver wants to go from a start index to an end index in the service lane.

You need to determine the maximum vehicle width that can safely pass through that segment.

📥 In the Input:
When they say:

Copy
Edit
8 5
2 3 1 2 3 2 3 3
0 3
4 6
6 7
3 5
0 7
8 → number of widths (length of the service lane)

5 → number of test cases (scenarios you need to evaluate)

Then come 5 test cases:

bash
Copy
Edit
[0, 3]  → test case 1
[4, 6]  → test case 2
[6, 7]  → test case 3
[3, 5]  → test case 4
[0, 7]  → test case 5
🧠 So a test case is:
A pair of start and end indices — asking: what is the narrowest point in this segment?

The answer tells you what kind of vehicle can fit.
