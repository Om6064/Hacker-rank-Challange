🏃‍♂️ What's the game about?
You're playing a game where your character needs to jump over hurdles of different heights.

🔢 You are given:
k: The maximum height your character can jump naturally.

height[]: An array of integers representing the height of each hurdle.

🍵 Magic Potion
If a hurdle is taller than what your character can jump (k), you need a magic potion.

Each potion dose increases jump height by 1 unit.

🎯 Your task:
Return the minimum number of potion doses required to jump over all the hurdles.

✅ If the character can already jump all hurdles:
Then you should return 0 (no potion needed).
