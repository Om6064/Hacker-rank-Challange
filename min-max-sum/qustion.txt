ðŸ§® What Youâ€™re Given:
You will receive five positive integers.

ðŸŽ¯ Your Task:
From those 5 numbers, choose any 4 numbers at a time.

For each such combination, calculate the sum of the 4 numbers.

Out of all the possible sums:

Find the minimum sum

Find the maximum sum

Print both values on the same line, separated by a space.

âœ… Example:
For input:

Copy
Edit
1 2 3 4 5
You can make these 5 sums by skipping one number each time:

2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14

1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13

1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12

1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

ðŸ‘‰ So print:

Copy
Edit
10 14
